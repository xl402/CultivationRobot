# CultivationRobot
2nd year Integrated Design Project for an AGV which collects models of different plants.


Team of 7, split into electrical, mechanical and software subteams, with a time constraint of **4 weeks** to produce a guided vehicle that suits the design specifications. Full detailes can be found on the university website:

## Task:
* The AGV is to follow the route specified using custom photodiodes
* To be able to detect, identify and collect cauliflower and cabbage models
* To avoid collecting undersized cauliflower and cabbage models
* Drop the plants in their designated areas
* Return to the starting area

## Result:
* AVG correctly identifies and collects all plant models that are on the ground
* Due to unreliable sensor readings when the AVG is on the hill, hill climbing algorithm implemented but not utilised on competition day
* Team obtains the highest score out of 12 teams in total thereby winning the competition
